I am excited to share my latest project, a simple yet functional To-Do List web application, designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and emphasizes my ability to create user-friendly interfaces and interactive web applications.
User Input: Users can easily add tasks to their to-do list using a straightforward input field. The application captures user input and dynamically updates the task list.
Responsive Design: The application is designed with a clean and modern aesthetic, featuring a black background with contrasting white text, ensuring readability and an engaging user experience.
Task Management: Each task added to the list is displayed with an option to delete, allowing users to manage their tasks effectively.
Local Storage Integration: Although not implemented in the current version, the application is designed with the potential for local storage integration to save tasks across sessions, enhancing user experience.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the web application.
CSS: To style the application and create a visually appealing layout.
JavaScriptâ€‹: For implementing dynamic features, such as adding tasks and handling user interactions.
